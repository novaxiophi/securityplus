    when you run the command git checkout -b my-new-feature, Git will create a new branch named "my-new-feature" and then switch to that branch. This is useful when you want to start working on a new feature or task isolated from the main codebase, making it easy to keep your changes separate until they're ready to be merged back into the main branch.
